<p>Analysis revealed significant spatial variation in nest density along the Marikina River. Regression results indicated that water-flow velocity and depth were key predictors of nest density, with higher nesting probability observed in areas with moderate flow and stable bank conditions. Monte-Carlo simulations produced probability surfaces identifying river segments with a high likelihood of nest concentration, highlighting zones vulnerable to erosion and invasive-species impact.
