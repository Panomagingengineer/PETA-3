<h1>Methodology</h1> <hr>
<p>Field data were collected from selected upstream, midstream, and downstream segments of the Marikina River. Each segment was divided into transects where nest counts were recorded to compute nest density per unit area. Hydrological variables—water-flow velocity, depth, and turbulence—were measured concurrently at multiple points within each transect and averaged per site.
A multiple linear regression model was used to evaluate the relationship between hydrological variables and nest density. To incorporate uncertainty and natural variability, a Monte-Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations was conducted, generating probabilistic nest-density estimates. Geospatial analysis was applied to map observed and simulated nest-density distributions along the river.
