<h1>Research Objectives </h1> <hr>
<p>The general objective of the study is to determine how hydrological variables influence the nest density of janitor fish through a mathematically grounded predictive model.
Specifically, the study aims to:
Measure and characterize water-flow velocity, depth, and turbulence across selected river segments. <br>
Identify, map, and quantify nest density using GPS-referenced field observations.<br>
Fit the predictive model using ordinary least squares.<br>


Conduct a Monte-Carlo simulation with 10,000 iterations to propagate measurement uncertainty and generate probabilistic nest-density surfaces.<br>
Determine sections of the Marikina River with the highest likelihood of nest concentration based on model outputs.<br>
Provide recommendations for ecological management and riverbank stabilization informed by mathematical predictions.
