<h1>Statement Of the Problem </h1> <hr>
<p>1. What are the measured values of water-flow velocity, depth, and turbulence along the Marikina River?<br>


2. What is the nest density and spatial distribution of janitor-fish burrows across the selected segments?<br>


3. How do the hydrological variables Vi, Hi, and Ti statistically predict nest density based on Formula (1)?<br>


4. What probability distributions of nest density emerge from Monte-Carlo simulations of the predictive model?
