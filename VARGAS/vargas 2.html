<h1>Statement of the Problem </h1> <hr>
<p>Cassava production in sub-Saharan Africa is severely constrained by whitefly (Bemisia tabaci) infestations and cassava mosaic disease (CMD), which together cause substantial yield losses. While whiteflies are known vectors of CMD, limited attention has been given to how seasonal dynamics of different whitefly developmental stages interact with cassava growth and CMD expression. The lack of integrated, season-long field analyses linking whitefly life stages, plant height, and CMD incidence and severity restricts effective disease forecasting and integrated pest management strategies.
