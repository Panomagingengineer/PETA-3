<h1>Methodology </h1> <hr>
<p> A field experiment was conducted during the 2020/2021 cropping season at Njala University, Sierra Leone, using 268 cassava genotypes and two improved checks under natural infestation conditions. Whitefly developmental stages, cassava mosaic disease (CMD) incidence and severity, and plant height were assessed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after planting. Data were analyzed using correlation analysis, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and seasonal trend analysis to examine relationships among whitefly populations, CMD epidemiology, and cassava growth.
