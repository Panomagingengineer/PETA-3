<p>Whitefly eggs dominated early colonization but had limited epidemiological relevance, while adult and nymph populations strongly influenced CMD severity and incidence between 6 and 9 months after planting. CMD showed a sigmoidal epidemic pattern driven by early cutting-borne infections and mid-season whitefly-mediated transmission. PCA revealed strong clustering of adult whiteflies with CMD variables at peak epidemic stages, followed by decoupling at late growth stages due to symptom persistence. Plant height showed minimal association with CMD dynamics.
