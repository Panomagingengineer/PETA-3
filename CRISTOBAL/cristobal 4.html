<p> The properties of rice husk ash (RHA) were strongly influenced by calcination temperature. RHA produced at 500–600 °C showed predominantly amorphous silica with better thermal stability, making it more suitable for practical applications. At higher temperatures (700–800 °C), silica became more crystalline, reducing reactivity and usefulness. Overall, controlled heating produced consistent and uniform RHA quality.
