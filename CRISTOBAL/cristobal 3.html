<h1>Methodology </h1> <hr>
<p>This study uses an experimental design to examine the effect of heating temperature on the structural and thermal properties of rice husk ash (RHA). Rice husks will be cleaned, dried, and calcined at different controlled temperatures. The resulting ash will be processed and analyzed to compare changes in structure and thermal behavior. Data from each temperature level will be evaluated to identify optimal conditions for producing high-quality RHA suitable for sustainable applications.
