<p>Calcination at 500–600 °C is recommended to obtain high-quality, reactive RHA.<br>


Controlled furnace heating should be used to ensure consistent ash properties.<br>


Optimized RHA can be applied in construction, soil stabilization, and insulation.<br>


Further studies should assess large-scale and field applications.
