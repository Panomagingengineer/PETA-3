<h1>Statement of the Problem </h1> <hr>
<p>The quality of rice husk ash (RHA) depends on heating temperature during production. Uncontrolled burning produces RHA with inconsistent properties, limiting its use in construction and environmental applications and causing possible environmental harm. This study addresses the need to identify proper heating conditions for producing high-quality RHA.
