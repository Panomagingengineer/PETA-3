<h1>Research Objectives </h1> <hr>
<p>
 To examine the changes in the structural composition and surface characteristics of RHA produced at varying heating temperatures.<br>


To evaluate the thermal stability of RHA under different calcination conditions.<br>


To identify the optimal heating temperature that produces high-quality, reactive RHA suitable for use in construction, soil stabilization, and insulation applications.
